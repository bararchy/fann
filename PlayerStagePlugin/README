Section: Plugin for the Player/Stage Robotics Simulator
Fast Artificial Neural Network Library (fann)

  This directory contains files for integrating FANN with Player/Stage, 
a robotics simulator.  The fanndriver is a generic driver that can take
inputs that it feeds into a FANN neural network.  The type of network 
and some parameters can be modified in the Player/Stage config file.
Currently, there are two examples in the libplayerc directory, one that
takes in robot positions and feeds them to a Self-Organizing Map.  The second
example uses a neural network that takes in laser readings from the robot 
and outputs a control vector that controls the robot.  This can be used to learn
an arbitrary control system, and in the example we use obstacle avoidance.  One
can easily modify it to train the robot via, for example, joysticking the robot
around.

Topic: INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLATION
  
  In order to compile this, you must copy all of the files in this directory
into the root directory of Player/Stage distribution.  It can be downloaded at:
  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=42445
  This code has been tested with the latest distribution as of 08/17/2007, 
Player 2.0.4 and Stage 2.0.3.  Untar the Player distribution and cd to that directory.
You must then copy all the files in this directory into the Player/Stage distribution, e.g.:

 [~/player-2.0.4]$ cp -r ~/fann/PlayerStagePlugin/* .

 You may then compile the entire Player/Stage distribution as instructed in their
documentation.  There is no need to modify the Stage distribution, but you must
compile it since the examples use the simulator.

Topic: SUPPORTED PARAMETERS IN CONFIGURATION FILE

  Player/Stage drivers can be configured in a special configuration file.

  The following parameters are supported to the driver:
    nettype (values: ANN,SOM,GNG)   - The type of network to be trained
    netname                         - Name of network file when saving/loading
    loadnet (values: 0,1)           - Specifies whether to load a network from file (the name of which is specified by the "netname" parameter
    numinput                        - Specifies number of inputs to the network
    numoutput                       - Specifies number of outputs from the network

  These parameters are valid only for ANN-type networks:
    numhidden (values: any integer) - Specifies number of hidden layers

  These parameters are valid only for SOM-type networks:
    som_width                                    - Width of SOM 
    som_height                                   - Height of SOM
    som_radius                                   - Radius of initial SOM neighborhood
    som_learningrate                             - Learning rate
    som_learningrateconstant                     - Learning rate constant (for decay function)
    som_topology (values: hex,rec)               - SOM topology type
    som_neighborhood (values: gaussian,distance) - SOM neighborhood function type
    som_decay (values: linear,inverse)           - Decay function type for learning rate
    som_maxtraining                              - Maximum number of training points

  These parameters are valid only for GNG-type networks:
    gng_maxnodes                   - Maximum number of nodes to grow to
    gng_maxage                     - Maximum age before a node is deleted
    gng_nodeinsertiteration        - Iteration number of node insertion
    gng_localerrorreductionfactor  - Scaling factor bet. 0 and 1 for err reduction of moved nodes
    gng_globalerrorreductionfactor - Scaling factor bet. 0 and 1 for err reduction of all other nodes
    gng_winningnodescalingfactor   - Scaling factor bet. 0 and 1 for movement of winning node
    gng_neighbornodescalingfactor  - Scaling factor bet. 0 and 1 for movement of neigh. nodes
  

Topic: INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING

  After compilation, you may run the example in the examples/libplayerc/ directory:

  To run the ANN example
  [~/] cd player-2.0.4/examples/libplayerc
  [~/player-2.0.4/examples/libplayerc] player fann_som_test.cfg &
  [~/player-2.0.4/examples/libplayerc] ./fann_ann_test

  To run the SOM example:
  [~/] cd player-2.0.4/examples/libplayerc
  [~/player-2.0.4/examples/libplayerc] player fann_som_test.cfg &
  [~/player-2.0.4/examples/libplayerc] ./fann_ann_test

  Note that you must have the fann and Player/Stage installed library directorys in your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH as well as the bin directory for Player/Stage in your PATH environment
variables.

  For the ANN example, you can either train the network from an arbitrary network or
test the network so that it controls the robot from a loaded ANN. In order to train 
the network, set the constant FANN_TRAIN in the fann_ann_test.c file,
and specify a network name in the configuration file.  After training is complete, 
you can then unset the constant, and specify loadnet option in the configuration file.
